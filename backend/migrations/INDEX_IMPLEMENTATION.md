# Database Index Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of database indexes for the GROW YouR NEED SaaS School Provider platform. The indexes are designed to optimize query performance based on common usage patterns identified in the application code.

- Comprehensive analysis of query patterns
- Detailed indexing strategy documentation
- Performance considerations and monitoring guidelines

### 2. `1737825600000_add_database_indexes.ts`
- Migration script to create all recommended indexes
- Includes both `up()` and `down()` methods for rollback capability
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

### 3. `performance-test.ts`
- Performance testing utility to validate index effectiveness
- Tests all major query patterns
- Provides timing measurements for optimization validation

## Index Categories

### Primary Indexes (Automatic)
- `id` field (primary key)
- `created` and `updated` timestamps
- Automatically managed by PocketBase

### Secondary Indexes (Implemented)

#### Calendar Events Collection
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_calendar_events_date ON calendar_events (date)
CREATE INDEX idx_calendar_events_user_date ON calendar_events (user, date)
CREATE INDEX idx_calendar_events_type_date ON calendar_events (type, date)
```

**Purpose**: Optimize date range queries, user-specific calendar views, and event type filtering.

#### Users Collection (Auth)
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_users_department ON users (department)
CREATE INDEX idx_users_role ON users (role)
CREATE INDEX idx_users_name ON users (name)
CREATE INDEX idx_users_email ON users (email)
```

**Purpose**: Optimize department filtering, role-based queries, name sorting, and email lookups.

#### Emails Collection
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_emails_folder_timestamp ON emails (folder, timestamp DESC)
CREATE INDEX idx_emails_sender_timestamp ON emails (sender, timestamp DESC)
CREATE INDEX idx_emails_timestamp ON emails (timestamp DESC)
CREATE INDEX idx_emails_unread_folder ON emails (unread, folder)
```

**Purpose**: Optimize folder-based email retrieval, sent email queries, timestamp sorting, and unread email filtering.

#### Knowledge Articles Collection
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_knowledge_articles_author ON knowledge_articles (author)
CREATE INDEX idx_knowledge_articles_title ON knowledge_articles (title)
CREATE INDEX idx_knowledge_articles_tags ON knowledge_articles (tags)
```

**Purpose**: Optimize author-specific queries, title-based sorting and searching, and tag-based filtering.

#### Marketplace Products Collection
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_marketplace_products_category_name ON marketplace_products (category, name)
CREATE INDEX idx_marketplace_products_price ON marketplace_products (price)
CREATE INDEX idx_marketplace_products_stock ON marketplace_products (stock)
```

**Purpose**: Optimize category filtering with name sorting, price range queries, and inventory management.

#### Games Collection
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_games_category_title ON games (category, title)
```

**Purpose**: Optimize category filtering with title sorting.

#### Media Content Collection
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_media_content_type_title ON media_content (type, title)
```

**Purpose**: Optimize media type filtering with title sorting.

#### Files Collection
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_files_folder ON files (folder)
CREATE INDEX idx_files_uploader ON files (uploader)
CREATE INDEX idx_files_folder_uploader ON files (folder, uploader)
```

**Purpose**: Optimize folder-based file retrieval, user-specific file queries, and combined filtering.

## Query Pattern Optimization

### Before Indexes
- Full table scans for filtered queries
- Slow sorting operations
- Poor performance on large datasets

### After Indexes
- Direct index lookups for filtered queries
- Fast sorting using index order
- Scalable performance as data grows

## Performance Testing

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run performance tests
node src/backend/migrations/performance-test.ts
```

### Expected Improvements
- **Date Range Queries**: 70-90% faster
- **Department/Role Filtering**: 60-80% faster
- **Email Folder Queries**: 80-95% faster
- **Search Operations**: 50-70% faster
- **Sorting Operations**: 40-60% faster

## Migration Execution

### Apply Indexes
```bash
# Run migration system to apply indexes
npm run migrate:up
```

### Rollback Indexes
```bash
# Rollback indexes if needed
npm run migrate:down
```

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Performance Monitoring
1. **Query Execution Time**: Monitor average query response times
2. **Index Usage**: Track which indexes are being used
3. **Storage Impact**: Monitor database size increase
4. **Write Performance**: Ensure indexes don't significantly impact writes

### Maintenance Tasks
1. **Regular Performance Reviews**: Monthly query performance analysis
2. **Index Usage Analysis**: Quarterly review of index effectiveness
3. **Storage Optimization**: Monitor and optimize storage usage
4. **Query Pattern Updates**: Update indexes as application evolves

### Key Metrics to Track
- Average query response time by collection
- Index hit ratio
- Database storage size
- Write operation performance
- Most frequently executed queries

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Slow Query Performance
1. Check if appropriate indexes exist
2. Verify query is using indexes (check query plan)
3. Consider adding compound indexes for multi-field queries

#### High Storage Usage
1. Review index necessity
2. Remove unused indexes
3. Consider partial indexes for filtered datasets

#### Slow Write Operations
1. Review number of indexes on frequently updated collections
2. Consider removing rarely used indexes
3. Optimize index design for write patterns

### Performance Debugging
```typescript
// Example: Check if query is using indexes
const result = await pb.collection('emails').getList(1, 50, {
  filter: `folder = 'Inbox'`,
  sort: '-timestamp',
  // Add explain option to see query plan (if supported)
  explain: true
});
```

## Future Considerations

### Potential Enhancements
1. **Partial Indexes**: Create indexes on subsets of data
2. **Covering Indexes**: Include additional columns in indexes
3. **Full-Text Search Indexes**: Optimize text search operations
4. **Composite Indexes**: More complex multi-column indexes

### Scaling Considerations
1. **Index Partitioning**: Split large indexes across partitions
2. **Read Replicas**: Use read replicas for query-heavy workloads
3. **Caching Layer**: Implement caching for frequently accessed data
4. **Query Optimization**: Continuously optimize query patterns

## Conclusion

The implemented indexing strategy provides significant performance improvements for the most common query patterns in the application. Regular monitoring and maintenance will ensure continued optimal performance as the application scales.
