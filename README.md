## About The Project

gymix is a web-based, OS-like dashboard designed to be a central hub for a modern provider saas to educational institution, organization znd individuals. It combines stunning visuals with powerful functionality, creating an intuitive and engaging user experience.

The entire interface is built around a **glassmorphic** design language, utilizing blurred backgrounds, vibrant gradients, and clean typography to create a sense of depth and modernity. The architecture is highly modular, allowing for easy expansion and management of different functionalities.

---

## Key Features

- **Modular Architecture:** The application is divided into distinct modules (`Dashboard`, `Analytics`, `School Hub`, etc.), each handling a specific domain of functionality.
- **Overlay Applications:** Full-screen applications like `Studio`, `Hobbies`, and `Marketplace` launch over the main interface, providing immersive, focused experiences.
- **Futuristic UI/UX:** A consistent and beautiful glassmorphic design is applied across all components, enhanced with smooth transitions and custom icons from `lucide-react`.
- **Centralized State Management:** A global context (`useAppContext`) manages the application's state, including active modules, open overlays, and the shopping cart.
- **AI-Powered:** Leverages the Google Gemini API to provide intelligent features, from a conversational AI assistant to content generation and data analysis tools.
- **Component-Based:** Built with React and TypeScript, ensuring a scalable and maintainable codebase.
- **No Build Step Required:** Uses an `importmap` in `index.html` to load ES modules directly from a CDN, simplifying the development setup.

## Project Structure

The codebase is organized logically to separate concerns and promote reusability.

```


---

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get a local copy up and running.

### Prerequisites

You only need a modern web browser that supports ES modules.

### API Key Setup

This project relies on the local ollama ai and openai api,google gemini api,claude api. for its AI features.

1.  Obtain an API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
2.  The application is hardcoded to look for the API key in `process.env.API_KEY`. Since this is a client-side application without a Node.js backend, you'll need to make the key available in your environment. For local development, the simplest way is to replace `process.env.API_KEY` with your actual API key string in the code where `new GoogleGenAI()` is called.

**Warning:** Do not commit your API key to a public repository. For a production deployment, this key should be managed securely.

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository or download the source files.
2.  Since there is no build step, you just need to serve the files from a local web server. The easiest way is using `serve`:
    ```bash
    # If you don't have serve, install it globally
    npm install -g serve

    # Navigate to the project directory and run the server
    serve .
    ```
3.  Open your browser and navigate to the local address provided by `serve` (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`).

## AI Integration

The Google Gemini API is a core part of the Aura OS experience, powering numerous features:

-   **Concierge AI:** Provides the conversational intelligence for the main AI assistant.
-   **AI Study Assistant:** Helps students with their homework by guiding them to answers without solving problems for them directly.
-   **Policy Generator:** Drafts formal school policies based on a topic and target audience.
-   **Community Feedback AI:** Analyzes raw text feedback to identify sentiment, key themes, and actionable suggestions.
-   **Predictive Analytics:** Forecasts future trends (e.g., student enrollment) based on historical data and contextual notes.
-   **AI Communication Drafts:** Assists administrators in writing clear and calm messages during crisis situations.
-   **AI-Assisted Grading:** Provides a first-pass grade and constructive feedback on student submissions based on a teacher-provided rubric.
-   **Smart Gap Detector:** Analyzes a set of student answers to identify common misunderstandings and suggest teaching strategies.
-   **Language Translation:** Seamlessly translates messages in the Parent-Teacher communication hub.
-   **AI Message Drafting:** Helps parents write polite and clear messages to teachers based on a simple intent.

This deep integration makes Aura OS not just a management tool, but an intelligent partner for its users.
